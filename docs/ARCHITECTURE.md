# 🍳 CloudKitchen — Architecture Overview

> A **"start here"** explanation of what this project is and how the pieces
> fit together. If you've never seen this repo before, **read this page first**.

## 1. What is CloudKitchen?

CloudKitchen is a **cloud-native, microservice-based food-delivery platform** —
think a stripped-down Swiggy / DoorDash. It's built as a **portfolio / learning
project** that demonstrates how a real production system is structured: many
small services talking to each other, deployed to Kubernetes, with proper
observability, CI/CD, and GitOps.

**The user-visible flow it implements end-to-end:**

```
  Customer signs up → browses restaurants → adds dishes to cart
  → places an order → payment is processed (mock) → an agent is assigned
  → order moves through statuses → notifications are logged
```

…and every step of that happens through **separate, independent services**
that talk to each other over the network.

---

## 2. The 9 application services (what each one does)

8 Go backend services + 1 React frontend. **Every backend service listens on
port 8080 inside its container** and exposes `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and
`/metrics`.

| # | Service | Language | Job |
|---|---------|----------|-----|
| 1 | **frontend** | React + Vite + nginx | The web UI you see in the browser. Also acts as a local API gateway in docker-compose. |
| 2 | **auth-service** | Go (Gin) | Registration, login, JWT issuance, role checks (`customer`, `restaurant-admin`, `delivery-agent`, `admin`). |
| 3 | **user-service** | Go (Gin) | User profiles and delivery addresses. |
| 4 | **restaurant-service** | Go (Gin) | Restaurants — create, list, fetch. |
| 5 | **menu-service** | Go (Gin) | Categories, menu items, food search (Redis-cached). |
| 6 | **order-service** | Go (Gin) | Cart (in Redis) and orders (in Postgres). The heart of the system. |
| 7 | **payment-service** | Go (Gin) | Mock payment processing (~10% simulated failure for realism). |
| 8 | **delivery-service** | Go (Gin) | Assigns delivery agents, updates delivery status. |
| 9 | **notification-service** | Go (Gin) | Logs notifications (email-style mock). |

## 3. The 3 backing services (data + messaging)

| # | Component | Why |
|---|-----------|-----|
| 1 | **PostgreSQL** | The system of record. One database (`cloudkitchen`) with a **schema per service** (`auth`, `users`, `restaurants`, `menu`, `orders`, `payments`, `delivery`, `notifications`) — each service owns its tables, nobody else touches them. |
| 2 | **Redis** | Fast in-memory cache. Used by `menu` (search results) and `order` (the cart). |
| 3 | **NATS (JetStream)** | The **event bus**. Lets services talk to each other **asynchronously** — see Section 5. |

---

## 4. The two ways services talk: **Sync** vs **Async**

Microservices need to communicate. Two patterns:

### 🔁 Synchronous (REST over HTTP)

Used when a service needs an **immediate answer** from another service.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant O as order-service
    participant M as menu-service
    O->>M: GET /api/menu/items/<id>  (is this still available?)
    M-->>O: 200 OK { available: true, price: 250 }
    Note over O: order-service WAITS for this reply before continuing
```

In CloudKitchen, sync calls are few:
- `order` → `menu` (validate items in the cart before placing the order)
- `order` → `restaurant` (validate the restaurant exists)

That's it. Almost everything else uses **events**.

### 📨 Asynchronous (NATS events)

Used for **fire-and-forget** notifications — when the publisher doesn't need a
reply, and multiple consumers may care.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    O[order-service] -- "order.placed" --> N{{NATS JetStream}}
    N --> P[payment-service]
    N --> NF[notification-service]
    N -. future .-> AN[analytics]
    N -. future .-> FR[fraud-check]
```

The publisher returns the moment NATS has stored the event. Consumers process
it on their own time. **Adding a new consumer (e.g. analytics) doesn't require
any change to the publisher** — that's the whole point.

### Side-by-side: when to use which

| | Synchronous (REST) | Asynchronous (NATS) |
|---|---|---|
| Used for | "I need an answer to continue" | "FYI, something happened" |
| Publisher blocks? | yes, waits for reply | no, fire-and-forget |
| 1 consumer or many? | exactly one | any number |
| If consumer is down | call fails | event waits in JetStream, replays |
| Adds coupling? | yes (knows the URL) | no (knows the subject) |
| Examples in our app | order → menu validation | order → payment / delivery / notification |

---

## 5. The 6 events and who handles them

Every service can be a **publisher** of some events and a **consumer** of others.
Visual overview:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    auth -- user.registered --> usr[user]
    auth -- user.registered --> notif[notification]

    rest[restaurant] -- restaurant.created --> notif

    order -- order.placed --> pay[payment]
    order -- order.placed --> notif

    pay -- payment.completed --> order
    pay -- payment.completed --> del[delivery]
    pay -- payment.failed --> order
    pay -- payment.failed --> notif

    del -- delivery.updated --> order
    del -- delivery.updated --> notif

    classDef pub fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#fb8c00,color:#000
    classDef con fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#1976d2,color:#000
    class auth,rest,order,pay,del pub
    class usr,notif con
```

🟧 = also publishes events   🟦 = only consumes

The same data, as a table:

| Event | Published by | Consumed by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user.registered` | auth | user, notification | New account created |
| `restaurant.created` | restaurant | notification | New restaurant onboarded |
| `order.placed` | order | payment, notification | Customer submitted an order |
| `payment.completed` | payment | order, delivery | Payment succeeded → fulfil + dispatch |
| `payment.failed` | payment | order, notification | Payment failed → cancel + notify |
| `delivery.updated` | delivery | order, notification | Delivery status changed |

> **Naming convention:** internally these events are NATS subjects under the
> `cloudkitchen.` prefix (e.g. `cloudkitchen.order.placed`). The broker code
> prepends that prefix automatically — service code uses just the bare name.

---

## 6. End-to-end walkthrough: "Place an order"

The single best way to understand the architecture is to follow one request.
The diagram below shows **every actor**, **every wire** and **what's sync vs
async** in a single order's life:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Browser
    participant T as Traefik
    participant O as order-service
    participant R as Redis
    participant M as menu-service
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant N as NATS<br/>JetStream
    participant P as payment-service
    participant D as delivery-service
    participant NF as notification-service

    Browser->>T: POST /api/orders (JWT)
    T->>O: routes /api/orders
    O->>O: validate JWT (role=customer)
    O->>R: GET cart:<customerId>
    R-->>O: cart items
    O->>M: GET /menu/items/<id>  (validate)
    M-->>O: { available, price }
    O->>DB: INSERT orders + order_items<br/>(status=PENDING)
    O->>N: publish "order.placed"
    O-->>Browser: 200 OK { order_id, status:"PENDING" }

    rect rgba(255,193,7,0.12)
      Note over N,NF: 📨 Async fan-out — order-service is already free
      N->>P: deliver "order.placed"
      P->>DB: INSERT payments (status=PROCESSING)
      P->>P: mock-process (~10% failure)
      alt payment succeeded
        P->>N: publish "payment.completed"
        N->>O: deliver "payment.completed"
        O->>DB: UPDATE order status=CONFIRMED
        N->>D: deliver "payment.completed"
        D->>DB: pick available agent + INSERT delivery
        D->>N: publish "delivery.updated"
        N->>O: deliver "delivery.updated"
        O->>DB: UPDATE order status=ASSIGNED
      else payment failed (~10%)
        P->>N: publish "payment.failed"
        N->>O: deliver "payment.failed"
        O->>DB: UPDATE order status=PAYMENT_FAILED
      end
      N->>NF: deliver every event
      NF->>DB: INSERT notification row (mock email)
    end

    loop every 3.5s
      Browser->>T: GET /api/orders/<id>/track
      T->>O: routes to order-service
      O->>DB: SELECT order
      O-->>Browser: { status }  (PENDING → CONFIRMED → ASSIGNED → …)
    end
```

**Note what doesn't happen:** order-service **never directly calls** payment /
delivery / notification. It just publishes an event and gets on with its day.
That's the whole point of NATS — services are **decoupled in time** (they don't
have to be up at the same instant) and **decoupled in knowledge** (no service
knows the URL of any other downstream service).

---

## 6a. Order lifecycle (state machine)

While the events are flowing, here's how the **order's `status` column** moves:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PENDING : POST /api/orders
    PENDING --> CONFIRMED : payment.completed
    PENDING --> PAYMENT_FAILED : payment.failed
    CONFIRMED --> ASSIGNED : delivery.updated (agent picked)
    ASSIGNED --> OUT_FOR_DELIVERY : delivery.updated
    OUT_FOR_DELIVERY --> DELIVERED : delivery.updated
    DELIVERED --> [*]
    PAYMENT_FAILED --> [*]
```

So when the frontend polls `/api/orders/<id>/track`, it sees the status walk
through these stages — that's what powers the animated "scooter on a track"
UI on the OrderTracking page.

## 6b. NATS JetStream internals (what's inside that 📨 box)

JetStream is what gives us **at-least-once delivery + persistence + replay**.
Inside the single NATS pod:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph nats[NATS pod - JetStream]
      direction TB
      stream[Stream: CLOUDKITCHEN<br/>subjects: cloudkitchen.&gt;<br/>FileStorage on PVC]
      c1[durable: payment-service-events]
      c2[durable: delivery-service-events]
      c3[durable: notification-service-events]
      c4[durable: order-service-events]
      c5[durable: user-service-user-registered]
      stream --> c1 & c2 & c3 & c4 & c5
    end

    O[order-service] -- "cloudkitchen.order.placed" --> stream
    AU[auth-service] -- "cloudkitchen.user.registered" --> stream
    PA[payment-service] -- "cloudkitchen.payment.completed" --> stream

    c1 -. delivers .-> PA
    c2 -. delivers .-> D[delivery-service]
    c3 -. delivers .-> NF[notification-service]
    c4 -. delivers .-> O
    c5 -. delivers .-> U[user-service]
```

Key bits:
- **One stream** (`CLOUDKITCHEN`) holds **every** event under the `cloudkitchen.>` wildcard.
- **One durable consumer per service** — bookmarks where that service has acked up to. If the service restarts, it resumes from the last ack, **not** the start.
- **AckExplicit + MaxDeliver = 2** — on handler error, JetStream retries **once**, then drops the message (poison-message safe).

## 10. Design choices worth highlighting

| Choice | Why |
|---|---|
| **Schema-per-service in one DB** instead of DB-per-service | Cheaper to run (one Postgres pod), still enforces "no cross-service joins" via separate schemas. Easy to split later. |
| **NATS JetStream** instead of RabbitMQ / Kafka | Lightest broker that still gives at-least-once delivery. Single Go binary, ~30 MB RAM, no Erlang VM or Zookeeper. |
| **Single umbrella Helm chart** | One `helm install` brings up *everything* (8 services + frontend + Postgres + Redis + NATS + IngressRoute). One values.yaml to edit. |
| **Traefik over nginx-ingress** | Native `IngressRoute` CRD + middleware composition is cleaner than annotation-driven nginx. |
| **GitOps via ArgoCD** (not `helm upgrade` in CI) | Cluster state == Git. Roll back = revert a commit. No imperative `kubectl` from CI runners. |
| **Distroless, non-root images** | Smaller (~17 MB Go images, ~63 MB nginx frontend), fewer CVEs (no shell, no package manager). |
| **Both AWS and GCP terraform** | You can deploy to either cloud — `aws-terraform/` (EKS) or `gcp-terraform/` (GKE). Helm chart is cloud-agnostic. |

## 11. How a new contributor onboards (recommended reading order)

1. **This file** — you're already here. ✓
2. [`docker/README.md`](../docker/README.md) — run the whole stack locally with `docker compose`.
3. [`helm/cloudkitchen/README.md`](../helm/cloudkitchen/README.md) — what the chart deploys + every Helm command.
4. [`docs/eks/README.md`](eks/README.md) — the 7-phase deployment runbook (works for GKE too, with minor cloud-specific tweaks).
5. Pick any service (e.g. `order-service/`) and trace one Publish / Consume call.

---

## TL;DR

CloudKitchen is **9 small services + 3 backing stores**, packaged in **one Helm
chart**, deployed to **GKE/EKS** via **Terraform + ArgoCD**. Services talk
**synchronously over REST** for queries, and **asynchronously via NATS
JetStream events** for everything that fans out (orders → payment, delivery,
notification). One database with one schema per service. Distroless containers.
GitOps end-to-end.

That's the whole picture.
